<h2>What is Datacoin?</h2>
Data is stored in the blockchain forever and can be retrieved using a transaction hash as an identifier. 
Datacoin is a platform that can be used by applications such as torrent trackers, encrypted messaging services, 
and can be used to store other kinds of small data - all censorship-free.</br>
Developers can store torrent files, certificates, and with future development, HTML pages and other kinds of meta-information 
in the Datacoin blockchain.</br>
Windows users can use a GUI wallet, Linux users should compile datacoind or Datacoin-QT from source (see instructions). 
Wallets are in development, and more features are coming soon, but the walletâ€™s current functionality is similar to other coins.
